This library adds support for [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) maps to the [Allegro](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/) game library. It is more or less functional, but is not quite yet ready for prime time.

Compiling the Library
=====================

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

 * allegro
 * allegro\_tiled
 * xml2
 * zlib

Then simply run `make` in the root folder to compile it.

Running the Example
===================

There is one example provided under examples, possibly with more to come. To run it, cd into example/mario and run `make run`. This will compile, link, and run it. Here's a ![screenshot](https://github.com/dradtke/Allegro-Tiled/tree/master/example/mario/screenshot.png).
